## Setting up a project with this template

1. Rename the `/template` directory to your project name. This name will also be the name of the Python package generated by this template.
2. Find and replace (Ctrl + Shift + R in most editors): 
   - `<TEMPLATE:project_name>`: The title of your project and package. Usually matches the source directory name. 
   - `<TEMPLATE:repository_name>`: The name of the repository on GitLab. 
   - `<TEMPLATE:project_description>`: A short description of your package. 
   - `<TEMPLATE:author_name>` and `<TEMPLATE:author_email>` across this project. 
   This will replace these strings in `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `mkdocs.yml`, `docs/index.md`.
3. (Optional) Configure a runner for your project via `Settings > CI/CD` on GitLab, and update the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file by uncommenting the stages you want.
4. (Optional) Install pre-commit hooks by running `pre-commit install` in the project root.
5. Delete this section of the README.
